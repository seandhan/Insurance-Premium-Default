# Insurance-Premium-Default

## Introduction


Premium paid by the customer is the major revenue source for insurance companies.  
Default in premium payments results in significant revenue losses and hence insurance companies would like to know upfront which type of customers would default premium payments.Â 


The objective of this project is to:
1. Build a model that can predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on premium payments.
2. Identify the factors that drive higher default rates.
3. Propose a strategy for reducing default rates by using the model and other insights from the analysis.


## Methodology

This project will be split into three(3) parts:

### [Part 1](https://github.com/seandhan/Insurance-Premium-Default/blob/main/Part%201.ipynb)
